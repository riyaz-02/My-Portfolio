          <p data-aos="fade-left">Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sk Riyaz, a passionate and ambitious Computer Science and
            Engineering student at JIS
            College of Engineering, specializing in Frontend Web Development. My journey in the tech world is fueled by
            a curiosity for cutting-edge technologies, a drive for creativity, and a commitment to continuous learning.
          </p>

          <h6 data-aos="fade-left">ðŸš€ Tech Enthusiast:</h6>
          <p data-aos="fade-left">I've immersed myself in various programming languages such as Java, C/C++,
            JavaScript, and Python. My
            proficiency extends to frontend technologies like React JS, enabling me to bring ideas to life through
            intuitive and engaging user interfaces. Crafting aesthetically pleasing and functional websites is not just
            a skill for me â€“ it's a passion.</p>

          <h6 data-aos="fade-left">ðŸ§  Beyond the Screen:</h6>
          <p data-aos="fade-left">It's not all about lines of code for me. I'm fascinated by the possibilities that lie
            at the intersection
            of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Exploring the realms of intelligent systems, I've ventured
            into projects like the Intellicare ChatBot, integrating voice assistance and AI to connect users with expert
            doctors seamlessly.</p>

          <h6 data-aos="fade-left">Here's to coding, learning, and creating a tech-infused future! ðŸš€âœ¨</h6>
